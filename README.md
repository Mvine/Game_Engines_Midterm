# About

This is my take on the Game Engines Midterm Maze. There are several things that I would like to improve but unfortunately none are very time allowing:

    -Each tile has it's own convex mesh collider instead of making seperate colliders for large flat planes
    -There is not much player feedback
    -UI is very minamal
    -Start and End Scene are not polished
    -No ability to pause and quit at any time
    -No ability for the user to determine their own mouse sensitivity
    -Tiles are very repetitive
    -Geometry is not baked
    -Lighting needs improvement
    -Player should face the right direction on respawn
